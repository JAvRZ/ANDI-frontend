1. Scripts JSON2CSV.R: This script should only be used by Anand. This is the first step to make life easy for Nathalie to add or remove tests from a csv file that are easy to use. This format is better suited for programming.

2. Scripts CSV2JSON.R: This script can be used by Anand or Joost, that would generate tests.json file. This is the data used within the website and can be directly fetched from here. This script take creation of JSON objects for tests by considering their relative position within the hierarchy of tests.
